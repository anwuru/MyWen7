> Articulated robots, also known as robotic arms, are robots that can pick up and move objects. They can either be mounted on a static base or be included as part of an AMR. They are found in many industries, picking fruit, constructing objects or sorting and packaging items for delivery. Using one or more Intel RealSense depth cameras as part of a robotic arm allows the robots to accurately size and grasp many different objects. It is also crucial for robotic arms to be able to differentiate between objects that may appear very similar in a 2D photograph. The use of depth means that the robot can distinguish and understand the shapes and sizes of multiple objects.
