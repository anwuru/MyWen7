Multimodal: sensory modalities

Multimodal Communicative Behaviors

- Verbal
- Vocal
- Visual

## Prior Research on Multimodal

- behavioral
- computational
- interaction
- deep learning

## Two core challenges

- Representation
  - Joint representations
  - Coordinated representations
- **Alignment** -- The very core
  - Can be seen as a specialization of multi-view learning
  - Explicit Alignment
  - Implicit Alignment
- Translations
  - Translating from one modality to another
  - Example-based
  - Model-driven
- Fusion
  - Model-Agnostic Approaches
    - Early Fusion
    - Late Fusion
  - Model-Based (Intermediate) Approaches
    - Deep neural networks
    - Kernel-based methods
    - Graph models
- Co-Learning
  - Parallel
  - Weakly-Parallel
